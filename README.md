# Run and deploy your AI Studio app

This contains everything you need to run your app locally.

## Run Locally

**Prerequisites:**  Node.js


1. Install dependencies:
   `npm install`
2. Run the app:
   `npm run dev`

3. To generate a static build:
   `npm run build`
   The compiled files will be in the `dist/` folder. Open `dist/index.html` directly in your browser to view the app without a server.
   If you accidentally open `index.html` from the project root, it will redirect you to the built file after running the build step.


   `npm run preview`
