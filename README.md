# Run and deploy your AI Studio app

This contains everything you need to run your app locally.

## Run Locally

**Prerequisites:**  Node.js


1. Install dependencies:
   `npm install`
2. Run the app:
   `npm run dev`

3. To generate a static build for offline use:
   `npm run build`
   This bundles React and Tailwind CSS locally so no external CDNs are required. The compiled files will be in the `dist/` folder. Open `dist/index.html` directly in your browser to run the app 100% offline.


   `npm run preview`
